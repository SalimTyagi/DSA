Hashing is a technique in which we can map a large amount of data to smaller table using a hash
function.

why it is so famous:
because using this hashing technique we can search the data more quickly and efficiently as compare to
other searching technique like Linear and Binary search.

because it uniquely identify a specific item from collections of item

Note:
 Large set of data ---> hash function ----> small data
